Assignment #:  4

Program due date:  4/22/18

Handed in date:  4/22/18

Source code file name(s):


cs1550.c




Other file name(s) (if relevant):



info_sheet.txt



Does your program run without error?: Yes

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

My Program should run relatively flawlessly. When appending to a file in PICO, it can get slightly buggy, but I am not sure if that is on fuse's end. Everything should work according to the description/rubric.


I have tested :

mkdir, cd, ls, cat, and pico
They all work as they should.



Additional comments to the grader:

I did not include a makefile, because I used the one in the fuse file system.
I am assuming that we did not need to make our own make file, because you will probably be doing testing in the fuse filesystem, so you will have one available. 

My program makes with a couple of warnings, but those warnings do not affect the execution from what I can tell. If there is a problem with making/compiling my program, please reach out to me.



I put 30ish hours into this project because I need to do well on it. If there is anything wrong with it in any way please e-mail me so we can discuss it. Thank you!
